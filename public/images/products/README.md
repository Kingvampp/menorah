## How to Add Product Images

To replace the emoji placeholders with actual product images, simply upload your images to this directory with the following naming convention:

### Naming Convention

```

### Examples

- `menorah-ring_2.jpg` - Second image for the "Classic Diamond Menorah" product
- `elegant-earrings_1.jpg` - First image for the "Elegant Pearl Earrings" product
- `bold-ring_1.jpg` - First image for the "Men's Signet Ring" product

### Product IDs Reference

1. `menorah-ring` - Classic Diamond Menorah
2. `elegant-earrings` - Elegant Pearl Earrings  
3. `bold-ring` - Men's Signet Ring

### How It Works
1. Upload your images with the correct naming convention
2. The website will automatically detect and display your images
3. If an image doesn't exist, it will fallback to the emoji placeholder
4. Images are displayed in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

### Quick Start
1. Take photos of your jewelry products
2. Name them according to the convention above
3. Upload them to this folder
4. Refresh your website to see the changes!

The system will automatically handle image loading and fallback to emojis if images are missing.
